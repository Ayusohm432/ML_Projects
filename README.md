### 📖 Project Description

This project focuses on solving a real-world problem using machine learning techniques. The aim is to \[briefly state the problem, e.g., predict customer churn, classify handwritten digits, detect fraud, etc.]. The dataset used is \[dataset name or source], and various preprocessing steps were applied to clean and prepare the data.

We trained and evaluated several ML models including \[mention models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, etc.], and selected the best-performing one based on metrics such as \[accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.].
